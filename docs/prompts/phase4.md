## Missing from Original Plan - Priority Items

### **üè† NEXT PRIORITY: Unified Main Dashboard** üéØ **START HERE**
**Replace the current basic dashboard with a comprehensive cosmic overview**

Currently users see individual feature dashboards, but there's no unified view showing the "big picture" of their productivity theater performance.

**Core Features to Build:**
- Replace current `/dashboard` with unified productivity command center
- **"Cosmic Perspective" Daily Widget** with philosophical observations
- **Cross-system statistics** combining tasks, habits, meetings, emails, achievements

- **Recent Activity Feed** with existential commentary
- **Achievement Highlights** showing recent unlocks and progress
- **Service Connection Status** with sync health indicators
- **Weekly/Monthly Insights** with cosmic humor and genuine value

**Technical Foundation:**
- Update existing `DashboardLive` with comprehensive data loading
- Create dashboard statistics functions that combine all contexts
- Build reusable dashboard widget components
- Implement "Cosmic Perspective" commentary system
- Add cross-system analytics with philosophical interpretations

### **üíé Premium Features & Subscription Integration**

- Trend analysis and pattern recognition
- Data visualization with existential commentary  
- Productivity coaching insights with cosmic humor
- Weekly/monthly comprehensive reports
- Predictive insights based on behavior patterns

## Development Guidelines
- Follow CLAUDE.md instructions exactly (in codebase)
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress throughout development
- No comments in code unless absolutely necessary  
- Keep functions small, self-documented, highly testable
- Use Phoenix LiveView with proper assigns and streams
- Maintain ironic tone in UI copy while ensuring genuine functionality
- Test after each major component implementation
- Run `mix format` and `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` before completion

## File Structure Context
- Main contexts in `lib/neptuner/`
- LiveViews in `lib/neptuner_web/live/`
- Routes in `lib/neptuner_web/router.ex` (use `:fully_authenticated_user` scope)
- Core components in `lib/neptuner_web/components/core_components.ex`
- OAuth integrations in existing service connection infrastructure
- Achievement system in `lib/neptuner/achievements.ex`

## Key Architectural Decisions Made
- **Separate OAuth system** from user authentication for service connections
- **Context-driven architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- **LiveView streaming** for real-time updates across all interfaces
- **Existential humor** balanced with genuine productivity value
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with consistent component patterns
- **Comprehensive statistics** with philosophical interpretations
- **Achievement integration** across all features with ironic commentary
- **Cross-system analytics** foundation ready for advanced insights

## Expected Outcomes
The next phase should create a unified productivity command center that showcases all of Neptuner's features in a cohesive, philosophically-aware interface that demonstrates the full value proposition.

**Unified Dashboard Success Criteria:**
- Single comprehensive view of user's entire productivity landscape
- "Cosmic Perspective" insights that provide genuine value with humor
- Cross-system metrics that reveal patterns and inefficiencies
- Achievement highlights that celebrate progress with appropriate skepticism
- Service health monitoring integrated into the main experience
- Recent activity that tells the story of the user's productivity journey

## Current Technical State
- **Application is 80% complete** with all core functionality working
- **Achievement system fully operational** with 15 achievements tracking progress
- **All major features have individual dashboards** but lack unified overview
- **Database schema complete** with comprehensive relationships
- **OAuth infrastructure robust** and ready for production use
- **LiveView architecture mature** with consistent patterns
- **Ironic tone established** throughout individual features

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start with Unified Dashboard** - this will showcase all existing functionality
2. Examine current `DashboardLive` and plan comprehensive replacement
3. Create cross-system statistics functions in each context
4. Build unified dashboard widgets with cosmic perspective
5. Integrate achievement highlights and recent activity feeds
6. Add service connection health monitoring
7. Implement "Productivity Theater Metrics" with existential insights

The unified dashboard will transform Neptuner from a collection of productivity features into a cohesive philosophical productivity platform that users will genuinely enjoy using while getting real value from their digital activity analysis.

**Remember**: The goal is to build something genuinely useful that happens to have a sense of humor about itself. The irony should enhance, not hinder, the user experience.
