# Neptuner Development Continuation - Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Intelligence

## Project Context
You are continuing development of **Neptuner** - a Phoenix SaaS productivity app that provides genuine functionality while maintaining an ironic, philosophical perspective on modern productivity culture. This is built on the Phoenix SaaS Template with Elixir/Phoenix, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and Phoenix LiveView.

## Next Phase: Advanced Analytics & Intelligence

### **Agent 7: Email/Communication Intelligence** ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDED NEXT**
**Leverage existing OAuth infrastructure for email analysis**

**Core Features to Build:**
- Gmail/Outlook integration via existing OAuth connections
- Email pattern analysis (volume, response times, importance classification)
- "Urgent but not important" communication detection
- Digital minimalism suggestions and inbox philosophy
- Email productivity scoring similar to meeting analysis
- Integration with task/habit/meeting data for holistic insights

**Technical Foundation:**
- Use existing `ServiceConnection` OAuth tokens
- Create `Neptuner.Communications` context
- Build `CommunicationsLive.Index` with email analytics
- Email classification: `:urgent_important`, `:urgent_unimportant`, `:not_urgent_important`, `:digital_noise`

### **Agent 8: Cross-System Analytics & Insights Dashboard**
**Unified productivity intelligence across all systems**

**Core Features to Build:**
- Combined analytics across tasks, habits, meetings, emails
- "Cosmic Productivity Score" calculations based on all data sources
- Time-based trends and pattern recognition
- Comprehensive philosophical productivity reports
- Data visualization with existential commentary
- Weekly/monthly coaching insights

**Technical Foundation:**
- Create `Neptuner.Analytics` context with cross-system queries
- Build advanced statistical analysis functions
- Create `AnalyticsLive.Dashboard` with rich visualizations
- Implement trend analysis and predictive insights

### **Agent 9: AI-Powered Productivity Coaching**
**Personalized existential productivity guidance**

**Core Features to Build:**
- AI analysis of productivity patterns across all systems
- Personalized existential insights and recommendations
- Smart suggestions based on behavior patterns
- Weekly/monthly coaching reports with cosmic humor
- Integration with external AI services for advanced analysis

## Development Guidelines
- Follow CLAUDE.md instructions exactly (in codebase)
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress throughout development
- No comments in code unless absolutely necessary  
- Keep functions small, self-documented, highly testable
- Use Phoenix LiveView with proper assigns and streams
- Maintain ironic tone in UI copy while ensuring genuine functionality
- Test after each major component implementation
- Run `mix format` and `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` before completion

## File Structure Context
- Main contexts in `lib/neptuner/`
- LiveViews in `lib/neptuner_web/live/`
- Routes in `lib/neptuner_web/router.ex` (use `:fully_authenticated_user` scope)
- Core components in `lib/neptuner_web/components/core_components.ex`
- OAuth integrations in existing service connection infrastructure

## Key Architectural Decisions Made
- **Separate OAuth system** from user authentication for service connections
- **Context-driven architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- **LiveView streaming** for real-time updates across all interfaces
- **Existential humor** balanced with genuine productivity value
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with consistent component patterns
- **Comprehensive statistics** with philosophical interpretations

## Expected Outcomes
The next agent should leverage the existing robust foundation of tasks, habits, meetings, and OAuth connections to create sophisticated analytics that provide genuine value while maintaining Neptuner's signature philosophical perspective on modern productivity culture.

**Agent 7 (Email Intelligence) Success Criteria:**
- Email analytics dashboard integrated with existing systems
- Smart classification of email importance vs urgency
- Digital communication insights with existential commentary
- Seamless integration with OAuth connection management
- Philosophical perspective on inbox management and digital minimalism

Start by examining the existing `Neptuner.Connections` context and OAuth infrastructure, then build the email analysis system that complements the existing task/habit/meeting triumvirate with communication intelligence.
