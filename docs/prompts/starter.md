# Build Neptuner: The Ironically Productive Task Management App

## Project Overview
Build "Neptuner" - a full-stack web application that provides genuine productivity features while maintaining an ironic, off-kilter perspective on modern productivity culture. The app should be both genuinely useful and gently subversive.

**Tech Stack:**
- Phoenix SaaS Kit as foundation (https://www.phoenixsaaskit.com/)
- Elixir/Phoenix backend (already configured)
- PostgreSQL database (already configured)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (already configured)
- Phoenix LiveView for real-time interactions (already configured)
- Authentication & user management (already included)
- Stripe payments integration (already included)
- Admin panel (already included)
- Multi-tenancy support (already included)

## Core App Concept
Neptuner helps users manage tasks, habits, and projects while providing cosmic perspective and gentle mockery of productivity obsession. It's functional but philosophically skeptical.

## Database Schema & Models

Create these core models with appropriate relationships:

**Users** (extends existing Phoenix SaaS Kit user model)
- Add cosmic_perspective_level (enum: skeptical, resigned, enlightened)
- Add total_meaningless_tasks_completed (integer)
- Leverage existing auth, profile, subscription fields

**Tasks**
- title, description
- cosmic_priority (enum: "matters_10_years", "matters_10_days", "matters_to_nobody")
- status (enum: pending, completed, abandoned_wisely)
- estimated_actual_importance (integer 1-10)
- belongs_to user
- completed_at, created_at, updated_at

**Habits**
- name, description
- current_streak, longest_streak
- habit_type (enum: basic_human_function, self_improvement_theater, actually_useful)
- belongs_to user
- has_many habit_entries

**HabitEntries**
- completed_on (date)
- existential_commentary (text) - auto-generated
- belongs_to habit

**ServiceConnections**
- provider (enum: google, microsoft, apple, caldav)
- service_type (enum: calendar, email, tasks) - allows multiple service types per provider
- external_account_id (string)
- external_account_email (string)
- display_name (string) - e.g., "Work Gmail", "Personal Calendar"
- access_token (encrypted)
- refresh_token (encrypted)
- token_expires_at (datetime)
- last_sync_at (datetime)
- sync_enabled (boolean, default: true)
- connection_status (enum: active, expired, error, disconnected)
- scopes_granted (array) - track which permissions were granted
- belongs_to user

**Meetings** (synced from connected calendars)
- external_calendar_id (string) - from connected calendar service
- service_connection_id (references ServiceConnections)
- title, duration_minutes
- attendee_count (integer)
- could_have_been_email (boolean, default: true)
- actual_productivity_score (integer 1-10) - user-rated post-meeting
- meeting_type (enum: standup, all_hands, one_on_one, brainstorm, status_update, other)
- belongs_to user
- scheduled_at, synced_at, created_at

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Cosmic Task Prioritization System
- Task creation form with cosmic priority selection
- Auto-suggestion engine that analyzes task descriptions and suggests most tasks "matter to nobody"
- Dashboard showing breakdown of task cosmic importance
- Weekly "Reality Check" that shows how many low-importance tasks were completed

### 2. Achievement Deflation Engine
- Custom achievement system with backhanded congratulations
- Examples of achievements to implement:
  - "Digital Rectangle Mover" (completed 10 tasks)
  - "Email Warrior" (sent 50 emails that could have been texts)
  - "Meeting Survivor" (attended 20 meetings)
- Achievement notifications should appear with gentle mockery

### 3. Habit Tracking with Existential Commentary
- Habit creation and daily check-in system
- Auto-generated commentary system (use a simple random selection from pre-written responses)
- Streak tracking with increasingly absurd celebration messages
- Habit categorization system (basic human functions vs. self-improvement theater)

### 4. Service Connections & Calendar Integration
- Unified service connection system for Google, Microsoft, Apple, CalDAV
- Support for multiple accounts per provider (work + personal Google accounts)
- Calendar sync with automatic meeting import and analysis
- Future email integration for task extraction and "email that could have been a task" analysis
- Post-meeting productivity scoring prompts
- AI-powered meeting classification (could have been email, actually useful, pure theater)
- Calculate "collective human hours lost" metric across all connected calendars
- "Could Have Been an Email" percentage tracking
- Weekly reports on meeting productivity with cosmic perspective commentary

### 5. Philosophical Dashboard
- Daily "Cosmic Perspective" widget
- Running tallies of meaningless tasks completed
- "Productivity Theater" metrics
- Random philosophical observations about modern work

- Success messages that celebrate achievements while deflating them
- Button text that's functional but occasionally wry ("Add Another Meaningless Task", "Complete This Digital Rectangle", etc.)

## Sample Copy/Content to Include

**Task Priority Descriptions:**
- "Matters in 10 years": "Genuinely important life decisions, relationships, health choices"
- "Matters in 10 days": "Legitimate short-term concerns with real consequences"  
- "Matters to nobody": "Digital busy work that exists because we forgot how to be idle"

**Achievement Examples:**
- "Email Archaeologist": "Successfully excavated meaning from 25 thread chains"
- "Notification Ninja": "Achieved inbox zero while 47 other apps demanded attention"
- "Digital Rectangle Mover": "Completed 100 tasks of questionable cosmic importance"

**Calendar Integration Examples:**

## Success Criteria

The app should:
1. Actually function as a useful productivity tool
2. Make users smile while using it
3. Provide genuine insights about task priority and time management
4. Feel polished and professional despite the irreverent tone
5. Load quickly and handle basic user workflows smoothly

## Getting Started Instructions

1. Clone/download Phoenix SaaS Kit and follow its setup instructions
2. Customize branding and configuration for Neptuner
3. Begin with Agent 1 (Database Extensions) to add Neptuner-specific models
4. Work through each agent sequentially, building on existing SaaS Kit features
5. Configure subscription plans in Stripe dashboard for Neptuner tiers
6. Test each major feature as it's built
7. Use existing deployment pipeline to deploy to staging/production

**Phoenix SaaS Kit Integration Notes:**
- Keep authentication separate from service connections - users log in with email/password or Phoenix SaaS Kit's existing auth
- Build service connections as a separate OAuth system for connecting external accounts
- Extend existing admin panel with connection monitoring, sync status, and Neptuner analytics
- Use existing email system for achievement notifications, weekly reports, and post-meeting rating prompts
- Build on existing component library and design system
- Integrate cosmic perspective features with existing user settings
- Use existing subscription management for premium tier features (connection limits, advanced analytics)
- Leverage existing OAuth implementation patterns but build separate connection flows
- Use existing background job infrastructure (Oban) for calendar syncing across multiple accounts
- Extend existing API patterns for calendar webhook handling and connection management

Remember: The goal is to build something genuinely useful that happens to have a sense of humor about itself. The irony should enhance, not hinder, the user experience.
